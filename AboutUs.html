        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>TechCo was born in 2018, from the vision of two friends who shared a passion for technology and
          entrepreneurship.
          Both had experience in the digital sector, but wanted to create their own company that offered a personalized
          and
          quality service to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
        <p>With an initial investment of $10,000, they rented a small office and hired their first employee. They
          started
          to
          offer web design and digital marketing services to their first clients, who were satisfied with the results
          and
          recommended them to others.</p>
        <p>Since then, TechCo has grown and evolved, incorporating new services and expanding its team. Today, TechCo
          has
          more
          than 50 employees, including designers, developers, marketing specialists and project managers. We have worked
          with
          more than 500 clients, from startups to large corporations, in different sectors and industries.</p>
